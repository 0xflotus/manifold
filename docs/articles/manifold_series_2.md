# Manifold: Part II

This is the second in a series of articles covering [Manifold](http://manifold.systems/), a unique, open source 
technology you can use in any Java project to enable cutting edge language features such as type-safe metaprogramming, 
extension methods, templating, and structural typing.  [Part one](##todo) introduces the Type Manifold API as a 
reinvention of code generators.  This segment explores [Extension Classes](http://manifold.systems/docs.html#extension-classes), 
a powerful feature for augmenting existing Java classes with user-defined methods, interfaces, and other elements.
