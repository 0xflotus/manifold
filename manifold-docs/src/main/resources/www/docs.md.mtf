## ${anchor("Manifold in a Nutshell")}

At its core [Manifold](https://manifold.systems/) is a unique framework to dynamically and seamlessly extend
Java's type system. Building on this core framework Manifold provides a set of
key features found in other programming languages and platforms:

* **Type-safe Metaprogramming** -- similar in concept to [F# _type providers_](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/information-rich-themes-v4.pdf)
* **Extension Methods** -- comparable to the same feature in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html) and [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods)
* **Structural Typing** -- much like interfaces in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html) and [Go](https://tour.golang.org/methods/10)

Leveraging these key features Manifold delivers a powerful set of Java extensions including **JSON**
integration, **JavaScript** interop, **Structural typing**, seamless **extension libraries** to Java's
runtime classes, and (coming soon) type-safe access to raw **SQL** and **DDL**.

At a high level each of these features is classified as either a **Type Manifold** or an
**Extension** via the **Extension Manifold**.

### ${anchor("Type Manifolds")}

Bridging the worlds of information and programming, type manifolds are Java
projections of schematized data sources.  More specifically, a type manifold
transforms a data source into a data _type_ directly accessible in your Java code
without a code generation build step or extra compilation artifacts. In essence with Manifold a data
source **_is_** a data type.

To illustrate, normally you access Java properties resources like this:

```java
Properties myProperties = new Properties();
myProperties.load(getClass().getResourceAsStream("/abc/MyProperties.properties"));
String myMessage = myProperties.getProperty("my.message");
```

As with any resource file a properties file is foreign to Java's type system -- there is no direct,
type-safe access to it. Instead you access it indirectly using boilerplate library code sprinkled
with hard-coded strings.

By contrast, with the Properties type manifold you access a properties file directly as a type:

```java
String myMessage = MyProperties.my.message;
```

Concise and type-safe, with no generated files or other build steps to engage.

Almost any type of data source imaginable is a potential type manifold. These
include resource files, schemas, query languages, database definitions, templates,
spreadsheets, web services, and programming languages.

Currently Manifold provides type manifolds for:

*   JSON and [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/)
*   JavaScript
*   Properties files
*   Image files
*   Manifold Templates (work in progress)
*   DDL and SQL (work in progress)


### ${anchor("The Extension Manifold")}

The extension manifold is a special kind of type manifold that lets you augment existing Java classes
including Java's own runtime classes such as `String`. You can add new methods, annotations, and 
interfaces to any type your project uses.

Let's say you want to make a new method on `String` so you can straightforwardly echo a String to the
console. Normally with Java you might write a "Util" library like this:

```java
public class MyStringUtil {
  public static void echo(String value) {
    System.out.println(value);
  }
}
```

And you'd use it like this:

```java
MyStringUtil.echo("Java");
```

Instead with Manifold you create an _**Extension Class**_:

```java
@Extension
public class MyStringExtension {
  public static void echo(@This String thiz) {
    System.out.println(thiz);
  }
}
```  

Here we've added a new `echo()` method to `String`, so we use it like this:

```java
"Java".echo();
```

Extensions eliminate a lot of intermediate code such as "Util" and "Manager"
libraries as well as Factory classes. As a consequence extensions naturally
promote higher levels of object-orientation, which result in more readable and
maintainable code. Perhaps the most beneficial aspect of extensions, however, relate more
to your overall experience with your development environment.  For instance,
code-completion conveniently presents all the extension methods available on an
extended class:

<p><img src="images/ext_demo.gif" alt="echo method" width="100%" height="100%"/></p>


There's a lot more to the extension manifold including [structural interfaces](#structural-interfaces), which are
similar to interfaces in the [Go](https://golang.org/) language. We'll cover more later in this guide.


### ${anchor("Benefits")}

Manifold's core technology is a dramatic departure from conventional Java tooling. There is no code
generation step in the build, no extra .class files or .java files to manage, no annotation processors, and no extra
class loaders to engage at runtime.

Benefits of this approach include:

*   **Zero turnaround** -- live, type-safe access to data; make, discover, and use changes instantly
*   **Lightweight** -- direct integration with standard Java, requires no special compilers, annotation
processors, or runtime agents
*   **Efficient, dynamic** -- Manifold only produces types as they are needed
*   **Simple, open API** -- you can build your own Manifolds
*   **No code generation build step** -- no generated files, no special compilers
*   **[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)** support -- all manifold types and extensions work with IntelliJ

Additionally, Manifold is just a JAR file you can drop into your existing project -- you can begin using
it incrementally without having to rewrite classes or conform to a new way of doing things.


## ${anchor("Setup")}

Using Manifold in your Java project is simple:

* Add the Manifold jar[s] to your classpath

## ${anchor("What Is a Type Manifold?")}

In recent years Java applications have shifted from a primarily code-centric nature
toward a more information-centric one. As the shift progresses applications depend on
ever richer, ever larger, ever more numerable sources of data. Despite this developers
continue to use decades old tooling, namely _type-bridge_ tooling, such as code
generators and static libraries, to connect their software to a newer, larger world of
information.

Conventional type-bridge tooling is symptomatic of a deeper problem, however.
Essentially, these tools serve as a crutch to shore up deficiencies in Java's type system.
For instance, a JSON object resulting
from a web-based API call has a logical type. The type may be inferred programmatically
or it may be provided directly via a schema such as a JSON Schema document. In
either case Java does not provide any direct means to project the JSON metadata
onto Java's type system as a first class type.  Thus we resort to code generators and
static libraries to bridge the gap.

As an application's dependency on this tooling grows, the clumsiness inherent
in its use becomes less an inconvenience and more a liability.  Code generators, for
example, add an expensive step to the build process, which not only breaks a
developer's concentration (perhaps the worst offense), it also creates a dependency
in automated builds on the code generator tool or its artifacts. Source control managers
often don't cope well with the generated files and, when large enough, the files should
be cached and shared, which requires yet more tooling. It's difficult to quantify their
impact on productivity, but over time the use of these tools is sure to slow progress.

What then is the alternative? Ideally if Java were to furnish a type-bridging API,
we could build type-bridging adapter components. Unfortunately, no such plans
appear on Java's horizon.  The JDK does, however, provide a compiler API and runtime hooks so that,
in theory, a 3rd party could develop such a framework independently.

Enter the _type manifold_ API.

Put simply, the type manifold API is a foundation of classes that works behind the
scenes with the Java compiler and runtime to directly connect your Java code to a specified data source.
A _type manifold component_, or just _type manifold_, implements the API to expose
the data source as a set of Java class projections. Class projections are real Java classes produced
on-demand by a type manifold, they are never compiled to disk, instead they serve as type
information bridges during compilation and executable code at runtime.  As such via class
projections a type manifold enables you to access data sources directly and type-safely in
your code. Above all, a type manifold represents a _live_ connection to information.
Changes you make to the structure of a data source are immediately available in your code,
with no compilation or build steps in-between. For all intents and purposes the data
source _is_ the type.

To illustrate, consider this simple example. Normally you access Java properties
resources like this:

```java
Properties myProperties = new Properties();
myProperties.load(getClass().getResourceAsStream("/abc/MyProperties.properties"));
String myMessage = myProperties.getProperty("my.message");
```

This is typical boilerplate library code, but since properties files are foreign to Java's type
system there is no direct, type-safe access to them.

With the properties type manifold, however, Java escapes the confinements of its
conventional type system.  The properties type manifold provides
a Java class projection of properties files, eliminating the need for the
`Properties` library:

```java
String myMessage = MyProperties.my.message;
```

Concise and type-safe!  And _on-demand_ -- type manifolds supply type information only
as required by the compiler and never generate files.  Likewise, at runtime
types are created and loaded lazily and don't require special class loaders.

Any type of data source accessible to Java is a potential type manifold. These include resource files,
schemas, queries, database definitions, data services, templates, spreadsheets, programming languages, etc.
 
Currently Manifold provides reference implementations for a few commonly used data sources:

*   JSON and JSON Schema
*   Properties files
*   Image files
*   JavaScript

We are working on support for more data sources including:
*   CSV
*   Template files
*   Standard SQL and DDL


### ${anchor("JSON and JSON Schema")}
[JSON](http://www.json.org/) has become the wire protocol of choice and, more generally, the preferred
structured data format. There is no shortage of JSON libraries for Java, these include 
[Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-docs), [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson), and a 
multitude of others.  They all do basically the same thing -- given a pre-defined or generated type, 
the libraries can read from and write to the type in terms of JSON:

```java
Widget widget = new Widget(bindings);
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();

String jsonStr = mapper.writeValueAsString(widget);
Widget result = mapper.readValue(jsonStr, Widget.class);
```

The JSON type manifold takes a different approach. Avoiding multiple systems of
record, instead of generating classes or weaving annotations into hand crafted
code the type manifold directly maps JSON sample files or JSON Schema files to
Java's type system as abstract types.

As this example illustrates, you work directly with a JSON bindings object as if it were a
Java class:

```java
Widget widget = (Widget) bindings;

String jsonStr = widget.toJson();
Widget result = Widget.fromJson(jsonStr); 
```

This approach eliminates library usage and connects your code directly to JSON metadata.
Another advantage involves object identity.  The `Widget` type is just
an interface directly on the JSON bindings.  The interface both abstracts and preserves the 
implementation details of the underlying JSON object -- the `Bindings` object isn't wrapped or proxied.
The type manifold achieves this via [extension interfaces](#extension-interfaces) on the
`javax.script.Bindings` object and through the use of [structural interfaces](#structural-interfaces) -- 
JSON types are structural interfaces. Essentially, the `widget` object _is_ the `Bindings` object; 
changes you make to `widget` are changes directly on the Bindings.  Additionally, like all type 
manifolds, there are no generated files or other build steps involved. 
 
Combining forces, Manifold [extension libraries](#extension-libraries) help reduce
common remote API drudgery involving JSON:

```java
WidgetQuery query = WidgetQuery.create();
...
WidgetResults result = (WidgetResults) query.postForJsonContent("http://acme.widgets/find");
```

This example uses the `postForJsonContent()` extension method which performs an HTTP Post using `query` 
JSON bindings and transforms the resulting document to JSON bindings, which is directly castable to the 
`WidgetResults` structural interface. 

### ${anchor("Properties Files")}

Many Java applications incorporate
[properties resource files](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html)
 (*.properties files) as a means of separating configurable text from code:

`resources/abc/MyProperties.properties`:
```properties
my.chocolate = Chocolate
my.chocolate.dark = Dark Chocolate
my.chocolate.milk = Milk Chocolate
```

Unfortunately access to these files requires boilerplate library code and the use
of hard-coded strings:
```java
Properties myProperties = new Properties();
myProperties.load(getClass().getResourceAsStream("/abc/MyProperties.properties"));

println(myProperties.getProperty("my.dark.chocolate"));
```

With the Properties type manifold we can access properties directly using simple, type-safe code:
```java
println(abc.MyProperties.my.dark.chocolate);
```

Behind the scenes the properties type manifold creates a Java class projection of the
properties file, which reflects its hierarchy of properties.  As you develop your
application, changes you make in
the file are immediately available in your code with no user intervention in
between -- no code gen files and no compiling between changes.

### ${anchor("Image Files")}

User interfaces frequently use image resource files for one purpose or another.  Java supports most of the
popular formats including png, jpg, gif, and bmp via a collection of utility classes such as
`javax.swing.ImageIcon` and `javax.scene.image.Image`.
  
As with any library, access to the underlying data source is indirect. Here we
manually create an `ImageIcon` with a raw String naming the image file.  This is
error prone because there is no type-safety connecting the String with the file
on disk -- your build process will not catch typos or file rename related errors:

```java
ImageIcon image = new ImageIcon("abc/widget/images/companyLogo.png");
```

Custom library layers often contribute toward image caching and other services:
```java
import abc.widget.util.ImageUtilties;

ImageIcon image = ImageUtilities.getCachedImage("abc/widget/images/companyLogo.png");
render(image);
```

The image manifold eliminates much of this with direct, type-safe access to image resources.
```java
import abc.widget.images.*;

ImageIcon image = companyLogo_png.get();
render(image);
```

All image resources are accessible as classes where each class has the same name as its image file
including a suffix encoding the image extension, this helps distinguish between images of 
different types sharing a single name.  Additionally image classes are direct subclasses of the familiar
 `ImageIcon` class to conform with existing frameworks. As with all
  type manifolds there are no code gen files or other build steps involved.

### ${anchor("JavaScript")}

The JavaScript type manifold provides direct, type-safe access to JavaScript files
as if they were Java files.

Here we have JavaScript resource file, `abc/JsProgram.js`:
```javascript
var x = 1;

function nextNumber() {
  return x++;
}

function exampleFunction(x) {
  return x + " from Javascript";
}
```

The type manifold maps type information directly to Java's type system so that
this JavaScript program is accessible as a Java class:

```java
import abc.JsProgram;

...

  String hello = JsProgram.exampleFunction("Hello");
  System.out.println(hello); // prints 'Hello from JavaScript'
  
  double next = JsProgram.nextNumber();
  System.out.println(next); // prints '1'
  next = JsProgram.nextNumber();
  System.out.println(next); // prints '2'
```

In addition to JavaScript programs you can also access JavaScript _classes_ directly.

This JavaScript defines class `Person` from file `abc/Person.js':
```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this._f = firstName
    this._l = lastName
  }

  displayName() {
    return this._f + " " + this._l
  }

  get firstName() {
    return this._f
  }
  set firstName(s) {
    this._f = s
  }

  get lastName() {
    return this._l
  }
  set lastName(s) {
    this._l = s
  }
}
```

You can access this JavaScript class file directly as a Java class:
```java
import abc.Person;

Person person = new Person("Joe", "Bloe");
String first = person.getFirstName();
System.out.println(first);
```

### ${anchor("Template Files")}

See project [Manifold Templates](http://manifold.systems/manifold-templates.html).

### ${anchor("Build Your Own Manifold")}

Almost any data source is a potential type manifold.  These include file schemas, query languages, database definitions, 
data services, templates, spreadsheets, programming languages, and more.  So while the Manifold team provides several 
type manifolds out of the box the domain of possible type manifolds is virtually unlimited.  Importantly, their is 
nothing special about the ones we provide -- you can build type manifolds using the same public API with which ours
are built.

The API is comprehensive and aims to fulfill the 80/20 rule -- the common use-cases are a breeze to implement, but the API is 
flexible enough to achieve almost any kind of type manifold.  For instance, since most type manifolds are resource
file based the API foundation classes handle most of the tedium with respect to file management, caching, and modeling.
Also, since the primary responsibility for a type manifold is to dynamically produce Java source, Manifold provides 
a simple API for building and rendering Java classes. But the API is flexible so that you can use other tooling as you
prefer.

Most resource file-based type manifolds consist of three basic classes:
* JavaTypeManifold subclass
* Model subclass
* A class to produce Java source 
 
The Image manifold nicely illustrates this structure:
```java
public class ImageTypeManifold extends JavaTypeManifold<Model> {
  private static final Set<String> FILE_EXTENSIONS = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList("jpg", "png", "bmp", "wbmp", "gif"));

  @Override
  public void init(ITypeLoader typeLoader) {
    init(typeLoader, Model::new);
  }

  @Override
  public boolean handlesFileExtension(String fileExtension) {
    return FILE_EXTENSIONS.contains(fileExtension.toLowerCase());
  }

  @Override
  protected String aliasFqn(String fqn, IFile file) {
    return fqn + '_' + file.getExtension();
  }

  @Override
  protected boolean isInnerType(String topLevel, String relativeInner) {
    return false;
  }

  @Override
  protected String produce(String topLevelFqn, String existing, Model model, DiagnosticListener<JavaFileObject> errorHandler) {
    SrcClass srcClass = new ImageCodeGen(model._url, topLevelFqn).make();
    StringBuilder sb = srcClass.render(new StringBuilder(), 0);
    return sb.toString();
  }
}
```
Like most type manifolds the image manifold is file extension based, specifically it handles the domain of files having 
image extensions: jpg, png, etc.  As you'll see, the `JavaTypeManifold` base class is built to handle this use-case.
First, `ImageTypeManifold` overrides the `init()` method to supply the base class with its `Model`.  We'll cover
that shortly.  Next, it overrides `handlesFileExtension()` to tell the base class which file extensions it handles.
Next, since the image manifold produces classes with a slightly different name than the base file name, it overrides 
`aliasFqn()` to provide an alias for the qualified name of the form "<package>.<image-name>_<ext>".  The name must
match the class name the image manifold produces. There are no inner classed produced by this manifold, therefore
it overrides `isInnerType()` returning false; the base class must ask the subclass to resolve inner types.  Finally,
the image manifold overrides `produce()`, this is where you produce Java source for a specified class name.

Most often, you'll want to create a separate class to handle the production of Java source.  The image manifold does 
that with `ImageCodeGen`:

```java
public class ImageCodeGen {
  private final String _fqn;
  private final String _url;

  ImageCodeGen(String url, String topLevelFqn) {
    _url = url;
    _fqn = topLevelFqn;
  }

  public SrcClass make() {
    String simpleName = ManClassUtil.getShortClassName(_fqn);
    return new SrcClass(_fqn, SrcClass.Kind.Class).imports(URL.class, SourcePosition.class)
      .superClass(new SrcType(ImageIcon.class))
      .addField(new SrcField("INSTANCE", simpleName).modifiers(Modifier.STATIC))
      .addConstructor(new SrcConstructor()
        .addParam(new SrcParameter("url")
          .type(URL.class))
        .modifiers(Modifier.PRIVATE)
        .body(new SrcStatementBlock()
          .addStatement(new SrcRawStatement()
            .rawText("super(url);"))
          .addStatement(new SrcRawStatement()
            .rawText("INSTANCE = this;"))))
      .addMethod(new SrcMethod().modifiers(Modifier.STATIC)
        .name("get")
        .returns(simpleName)
        .body(new SrcStatementBlock()
          .addStatement(
            new SrcRawStatement()

              .rawText("  return INSTANCE != null ? INSTANCE : new " + simpleName +

Here the image manifold utilizes `SrcClass` to build a Java source model of image classes.  `SrcClass` is a
source code production utility in the Manifold API.  It's simple and handles basic code generation use-cases.
Feel free to use other Java source code generation tooling if `SrcClass` does not suit your use-case, because
ultimately you're only job here is to produce a `String` consisting of Java source for your class.

The third and final class the image manifold provides is the `Model` class:

```java
class Model extends AbstractSingleFileModel {
  String _url;

  Model(String fqn, Set<IFile> files) {
    super(fqn, files);
    assignUrl();
  }

  private void assignUrl() {
    try {
      _url = getFile().toURI().toURL().toString();
    } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
      throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
  }

  public String getUrl() {
    return _url;
  }

  @Override
  public void updateFile(IFile file) {
    super.updateFile(file);
    assignUrl();
  }
}
```

This class models the image data necessary for `ImageCodeGen` to produce source as a `AbstractSingleFileModel` subclass. 
In this case the model data is simply the URL for the image. Additionally, `Model` overrides `updateFile()` to keep the
URL up to date in environments where it can change, such as in an IDE.

As you can see building a type manifold can be relatively simple. The image manifold illustrates the basic structure of
most resource file-based manifolds. Of course there's much more to the API. Examine the source code for other manifolds such as the JSON manifold ([manifold-json](https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold/tree/master/manifold-json))
and the JavaScript manifold ([manifold-js](https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold/tree/master/manifold-js)).  These
serve as decent reference implementations for wrapping existing code generators and binding to existing languages, 
respectively.


## ${anchor("Extension Classes")}

Similar to other languages such as 
[C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/csharp), [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), and
[Gosu](https://gosu-lang.github.io/), with Manifold you can define methods and other features as logical 
extensions to existing Java classes. This is achieved using _extension classes_. An extension class is a 
normal Java class you define as a container for features you want to apply to another class, normally to 
one you can't modify directly, such as `java.lang.String`:

```java
package extensions.java.lang.String;

import manifold.ext.api.*;

@Extension
public class MyStringExtension {

  public static void print(@This String thiz) {
    System.out.println(thiz);
  }

  @Extension
  public static String lineSeparator() {
    return System.lineSeparator();
  }
}
```

All extension classes must be rooted in the `extensions` package where the remainder of the package
must be the qualified name of the extended class. As the example illustrates, an extension
class on `java.lang.String` must reside directly in package `extensions.java.lang.String`. Note this
convention facilitates the extension discovery process and avoids the overhead and ceremony of
alternative means such as annotation processors.

Additionally, an extension class must be annotated with `manifold.ext.api.Extension`, which distinguishes
extension classes from other classes that may reside in the same package.

### ${anchor("Extension Method Basics")}

An extension method must be declared `static` and non-`private`. As the receiver of the call, the first
parameter of an extension _instance_ method must have the same type as the extended class. The
`MyStringExtension` example illustrates this; the first parameter of instance method `print` is
`java.lang.String`. Note the parameter name _thiz_ is conventional, you can use any name you like.
Finally, the receiver parameter must be annotated with `manifold.ext.api.This` to distinguish it from 
regular methods in the class.

That's all there is to it. You can use extensions just like normal methods on the extended class:

```java
String name = "Manifold";
name.print();
```

You can define `static` extension methods too. Since static methods don't have a receiver, the method
itself must be annotated with `manifold.ext.api.Extension`:

```java
@Extension
public static String lineSeparator() {
  return System.lineSeparator();
}
```

Call static extensions just as if they were on the extended class:

```java
String.lineSeparator()
```

### ${anchor("Generics")}

You can extend generic classes too and define generic methods. This is how Manifold extension libraries
work with collections and other generic classes. For example, here is the `first()` extension method on
`Iterable`:

```java
public static <T> T first(@This Iterable<T> thiz, Predicate<T> predicate) {
  for (T element: thiz) {
    if (predicate.test(element)) {
      return element;
    }
  }
  throw new NoSuchElementException();
}
```

Notice the extension is a generic method with the same type variable designation as the
extended class: `T` from `Iterable<T>`. Since extension methods are static this is how we convey type
variables from the extended class to the extension method. Note type variable names must match the 
extended type's type variables and must be declared in the same order.

To define a generic extension method you append the type variables of the method to the list of the
extended class' type variables. Manifold's `map()` extension illustrates this format:

```java
public static <E, R> Stream<R> map(@This Collection<E> thiz, Function<? super E, R> mapper) {
  return thiz.stream().map(mapper);
}
```

Here `map` is a generic extension method having type variable `R` and conveying `Collection`'s type
variable `E`.

### ${anchor("Static Dispatching")}

An extension class does not physically alter its extended class; the methods defined in an extension are
not really inserted into the extended class. Instead the Java compiler and Manifold cooperate to make a
call to a static method in an extension look like a call to an instance method on the extended class. As a
consequence extension calls dispatch **statically**.

So unlike a virtual method call an extension call is always made based on the extended type declared in
the extension, not the runtime type of the left hand side of the call. To illustrate:

```java
public class Tree {
}

public class Dogwood extends Tree {
}

public static void bark(@This Tree thiz) {
  println("rough");
}
public static void bark(@This Dogwood thiz) {
  println("ruff");
}

Tree tree = new Dogwood();
tree.bark(); // "rough"
```

At compile-time `tree` is of type `Tree`, therefore it transforms to a static invocation of `bark(Tree)`,
which prints "rough".

Another consequence of static dispatching is that an extension method can receive a call even if the value
of the extended object is `null` at the call site. Manifold extension libraries exploit this feature to
improve readability and null-safety. For example, `CharSequence.isNullOrEmpty()` compares the
receiver's value to null so you don't have to:

```java
public static boolean isNullOrEmpty(@This CharSequence thiz) {
  return thiz == null || thiz.length() == 0;
}

String name = null;
if (name.isNullOrEmpty()) {
  println("empty");
}
```

Here the example doesn't check for null and instead shifts the burden to the extension.

### ${anchor("Accessibility and Scope")}

An extension method never shadows or overrides a class method; when an extension method's name and
parameters match a class method, the class method always has precedence over the extension. For example:

```java
public class Tree {
  public void kind() {
    println("evergreen");
  }
}

public static void kind(@This Tree thiz) {
  println("binary");
}
```

The extension method never wins, a call to `kind()` always prints "evergreen". Additionally, if at
compile-time `Tree` and the extension conflict as in the example, the compiler warns of the conflict
in the extension class.

An extension method can still _overload_ a class method where the method names are the same, but the 
parameter types are different:

```java
public class Tree {
  public void harvest() {
    println("nuts");
  }
}

public static void harvest(@This Tree thiz, boolean all) {
  println(all ? "wood" : thiz.harvest());
}
```

A call to `tree.harvest(true)` prints "wood".

Since extension method references resolve at compile-time, you can limit the compile-time accessibility
of an extension class simply by limiting the scope of the JAR file containing the extension. For example,
if you're using Maven the scope of an extension matches the dependency relationship you assign in your
pom.xml file. Similarly in module-aware IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA, an extension's scope is the same as
the module's.

### ${anchor("Annotation Extensions")}

In addition to adding new methods, extension classes can also add _annotations_ to a class. At present
annotation extensions are limited to the extended _class_; you can't yet add annotations to members of 
the class.

Beware, extensions are limited to a compile-time existence. Therefore, even if an 
annotation has `RUNTIME` retention, it will only be present on the extended class at compile-time. This 
feature is most useful when using annotation processors and you need to annotate classes you otherwise 
can't modify.

Also it's worth pointing out you can make existing interfaces _structural_ using annotation extensions:

```java
package extensions.abc.Widget;
@Extension
@Structural // makes the interface structural
public class MyWidgetExtension {
}
```

This extension effectively changes the `abc.Widget` _nominal_ interface to a _structural_ interface. In the context
of your project classes no longer have to declare they implement it nominally.  

See [Structural Interfaces](#structural-interfaces) later in this guide for fuller coverage of the topic.

### ${anchor("Extension Interfaces")}

An extension class can add structural interfaces to its extended class.  This feature helps with a 
variety of use-cases.  For example, let's say we have a class `Foo` and interface `Hello`:
  
```java
public final class Foo {
  public String sayHello() {
    return "hello";      
  }
}

@Structural
public interface Hello {
  String sayHello();
}
```

Although `Foo` does not implement `Hello` nominally, it defines the `sayHello()` method that otherwise 
satisfies the interface.  Let's assume we don't control `Foo`'s implementation, but we need it to
implement `Hello` nominally.  We can do that with an extension interface:

```java
@Extension
public class MyFooExtension implements Hello {
}
```

Now the compiler believes `Foo` directly implements `Hello`: 

```java
Hello hello = new Foo();
hello.sayHello();
```
Note `Hello` is structural, so even without the extension interface, instances of `Foo` are still 
compatible with `Hello`. It's less convenient, though, because you have to explicitly cast `Foo` to `Hello` --
a purely structural relationship in Manifold requires a cast. Basically extension interfaces save you
from casting. This not only
improves readability, it also prevents confusion in cases involving type inference where it may not be 
obvious that casting is necessary.

It's worth pointing out you can both add an interface _and_ implement its methods
by extension:
```java
public final class Shy {
}

@Extension
public abstract class MyShyExtension implements Hello {
  public static String sayHello(@This Shy thiz) {
    return "hi";    
  }
}
```
This example extends `Shy` to nominally implement `Hello` _and_ provides the `Hello` implementation. Note
the abstract modifier on the extension class.  This is necessary because it doesn't really implement the
interface, the extended class does.

You can also use extension interfaces to extract interfaces from classes you don't
control.  For example, if you want to provide an immutable view of a collection class
such as `java.util.List`, you could use extension interfaces to extract immutable and
mutable interfaces from the class.  As such your code is better suited to confine
`List` operations on otherwise fully mutable lists.


### ${anchor("Extension Libraries")}

An extension library is a logical grouping of functionality defined by a set of extension classes.
Manifold includes several extension libraries for commonly used classe, many of which are adapted
from Kotlin extensions.  Each library is available as a separate module or Jar file you can add 
to your project separately depending on its needs.

*   **Collections**

    Defined in module `manifold-collections` this library extends:
    - java.lang.Iterable
    - java.util.Collection
    - java.util.List
    - java.util.stream.Stream

*   **Text**

    Defined in module `manifold-text` this library extends:
    - java.lang.CharSequence
    - java.lang.String

*   **I/O**

    Defined in module `manifold-io` this library extends:
    - java.io.BufferedReader
    - java.io.File
    - java.io.InputStream
    - java.io.OutputStream
    - java.io.Reader
    - java.io.Writer

*   **Web/Json**
 
    Defined in module `manifold-json` this library extends:
    - java.net.URL
    - javax.script.Bindings


## ${anchor("Structural Interfaces")}

Java is a _nominally_ typed language -- types are assignable based on the names declared in their
definitions. For example:

```java
public class Foo {
  public void hello() {
    println("hello");
  }
}

public interface Greeting {
  void hello();
}

Greeting foo = new Foo(); // error
```

This does not compile because `Foo` does not explicitly implement `Greeting` by name in its `implements`
clause.

By contrast a _structurally_ typed language has no problem with this example.  Basically, structural typing
requires only that a class implement interface _methods_, there is no need for a class to declare that it
implements an interface.

Although nominal typing is perhaps more sound and easier for both people and machines to digest, in some
circumstances the flexibility of structural typing makes it more suitable. Take the following classes:

```java
public class Rectangle {
  public double getX();
  public double getY();
  ...
}

public class Point {
  public double getX();
  public double getY();
  ...
}

public class Component {
  public int getX();
  public int getY();
  ...
}
```

Let's say we're tasked with sorting instances of these according to location in the coordinate plane, say
as a `Comparator` implementation. Each class defines methods for obtaining X, Y coordinates, but these
classes don't implement a common interface. We don't control the implementation of the classes, so we're
faced with having to write three distinct, yet nearly identical, Comparators.

This is where the flexibility of structural interfaces could really help. If Java supported it, we'd
declare a structural interface with `getX()` and` getY()` methods and write only one `Comparator`:

```java
public interface Coordinate {
  double getX();
  double getY();
}

Comparator<Coordinate> coordSorter = new Comparator<>() {
  public int compare(Coordinate c1, Coordinate c2) {
    int res = c1.Y == c2.Y ? c1.X - c2.X : c2.Y - c1.Y;
    return res < 0 ? -1 : res > 0 ? 1 : 0;
  }
}

List<Point> points = Arrays.asList(new Point(2, 1), new Point(3, 5), new Point(1, 1));
Collections.sort(points, coordSorter); // error
```

Of course Java is not happy with this because because `Point` does not nominally implement `Coordinate`. 

This is where Manifold can help with structural interfaces:

```java
@Structural
public interface Coordinate {
  double getX();
  double getY();
}
```

Adding `@Structural` to `Coordinate` effectively changes it to behave _structurally_ -- Java no longer
requires classes to implement it by name, only its methods must be implemented.

Note a class can still implement a structural interface nominally. Doing so helps both people and tooling 
comprehend your code faster. The general idea is to use an interface structurally when you otherwise can't 
use it nominally or doing so overcomplicates your code.


### ${anchor("Type Assignability and Variance")}

A type is assignable to a structural interface if it provides compatible versions of all the
methods declared in the interface. The use of the term _compatible_ here instead of _identical_ is
deliberate. The looser term concerns the notion that a structural interface method is variant with respect
to the types in its signature:

```java
@Structural
public interface Capitalizer {
  CharSequence capitalize(String s);
}

public static class MyCapitalizer {
  public String capitalize(CharSequence s) {
    return s.isNullOrEmpty() ? "" : Character.toUpperCase(s.charAt(0)) + s.substring(1);
  }
}
```

At first glance it looks like `MyCapitaizer` does not satisfy the structure of `Capitalizer`, neither the
parameter type nor the return type of the method match the interface. After careful inspection, however,
it is clear the methods are call-compatible from the perspective of `Capitalizer`:

```java
Capitalizer cap = (Capitalizer) new MyCapitalizer();
CharSequence properName = cap.capitalize("tigers");
```

`MyCapitalizer`'s method can be called with `Capitalizer`'s `String` parameter because `MyCapitalizer`'s
`CharSequence` parameter is assignable from `String` -- _contravariant_ parameter types support
call-compatibility. Similarly we can accept `MyCapitaizer`'s `String` return type because it is
assignable to `Capitalizer`'s `CharSequence` return type -- _covariant_ return types support
call-compatibility. Therefore, even though their method signatures aren't identical, `MyCapitalizer` is
structurally assignable to `Capitalizer` because it is safe to use in terms of `Capitalizer`'s methods.

Signature variance also supports primitive types.  You may have spotted this in the `Component`
class referenced earlier in the `Coordinate` example where `Component.getX()` returns `int`, not `double`
as declared in `Coordinate.getX()`. Because `int` coerces to `double` with no loss of precision
the method is call-compatible. As a result signature variance holds for primitive types as well as
reference types.

### ${anchor("Implementation by Field")}

Another example where classes have wiggle room implementing structural interfaces involves property 
getter and setter methods, a.k.a. accessors and mutators. Essentially, a property represents a value you 
can access and/or change. Since a field is basically the same thing a class can implement a getter and/or 
a setter with a field:

```java
@Structural
public interface Name {
  String getName();
  void setName(String name);
}

public class Person {
  public String name;
}

Name person = (Name) new Person();
person.setName("Bubba");
String name = person.getName();
```                                                             

Basically a field implements a property method if its name matches the method's name minus the 
is/get/set prefixes and taking into account field naming conventions. For example, fields `Name`, `name`, 
and `_name` all match the `getName()` property method and are weighted in that order.


### ${anchor("Implementation by Extension")}

It's possible to implement methods of a structural interface via extension methods.  Looking back at the
`Coordinate` example, consider this class:
```java
public class Vector {
  private double _magnitude;
  private double _direction;
  
  public Vector(double magnitude, double direction) {
    _magnitude = magnitude;
    _direction = direction;
  }
  
  // Does not have X, Y coordinate methods  :(
}
```

In physics a vector and a coordinate are different ways of expressing the same thing; they can be converted 
from one to another.  So it follows the `coordSorter` example can sort `Vector` instances in terms of X, Y 
`Coordinates`... if `Vector` supplied `getX()` and `getY()` methods, which it does not.

What if an extension class supplied the methods?
  
```java
@Extension
public class MyVectorExtension {
  public double getX(@This Vector thiz) {
    return thiz.getMagnitude() * Math.cos(thiz.getDirection()); 
  }
  public double getY(@This Vector thiz) {
    return thiz.getMagnitude() * Math.sin(thiz.getDirection()); 
  }
}
```

Voila! `Vector` now structurally implements `Coordinate` and can be used with `coordSorter`.

Generally _implementation by extension_ is a powerful technique to provide a common API for classes your 
project does not control.

  
### ${anchor("Dynamic Typing with `ICallHandler`")}

Manifold supports a form of dynamic typing via `manifold.ext.api.ICallHandler`:  

```java
public interface ICallHandler {
  /**
   * A value resulting from #call() indicating the call could not be dispatched.
   */
  Object UNHANDLED = new Object() {
    @Override
    public String toString() {
      return "Unhandled";
    }
  };

  /**
   * Dispatch a call to an interface method.
   *
   * @param iface The extended interface and owner of the method
   * @param name The name of the method
   * @param returnType The return type of the method
   * @param paramTypes The parameter types of the method
   * @param args The arguments from the call site
   * @return The result of the method call or UNHANDLED if the method is not dispatched.  
   *   Null if the method's return type is void.
   */
  Object call(Class iface, String name, Class returnType, Class[] paramTypes, Object[] args);
}
```

A class can implement `ICallHandler` nominally or it can be made to implement it via extension class.
Either way instances of the class can be cast to _any_ structural interface where structural calls
dispatch to `ICallHandler.call()`.  The class' implementation of `call()` can delegate the call any 
way it chooses.

For instance, via class extension Manifold provides `ICallHandler` support for `java.util.Map` so that 
getter and setter calls work directly with values in the map:

```java
Map<String,Object> map = new HashMap<>();
Name person = (Name) map;
person.setName("Manifold");
println(person.getName());
```
 
Because `Map` is a `ICallHandler` instances of it can be cast to any structural interface, such as
`Name` from the earlier example.  The `ICallHandler` implementation transforms get/set property calls
to get/put calls into the map using the name of the property in the method.  Additionally, method calls
can be made on map entries where the entry key matches the name of the method and the value is an instance
of a functional interface matching the signature of the call:

```java
map.put( "run", (Runnable)()-> println("hello") );
Runnable runner = (Runnable) map;
runner.run();
```

This example prints "run" because `Map.call()` dispatches the call to the "run" entry having a 
`Runnable` functional interface value.

Note the similarity of this functionality on `Map` with _expando_ types in dynamic languages.  The
main difference is that invocations must be made through structural interfaces and not directly on 
the map, otherwise `Map` behaves much like an expando object.

See `extensions.java.util.Map.MapStructExt.java` for details.

## ${anchor("Use with other JVM Languages")}

Manifold is foremost a JVM development tool.  It works straightaway with the Java Language and Java 
compiler.  It's also designed for use within other JVM languages via the _plugin host_ API. You can
implement this API to host Manifold from within another JVM language.

See _manifold.api.host.IManifoldHost_. 

## ${anchor("Philosophy")}

Our goal is to improve Java by working with it, not against it.  For instance, we're not out 
to bolt on new features involving new keywords, new grammar, or DSLs -- Java should look like Java. 
Rather Manifold is about empowering Java from the _outside_.  Thus, developers using
Manifold don't need to learn a new way of using or declaring things, instead Manifold enables 
them to access a whole new world of types and extensions using the Java they already know.
