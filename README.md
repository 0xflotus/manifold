# Intro
[Manifold](https://manifold.systems/) is a unique framework to dynamically and _seamlessly_ extend
Java. Building on this core framework Manifold supplements Java with new features you can use in your applications:

* **Type-safe Metaprogramming** -- renders code generators obsolete, similar in concept to [F# _type providers_](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/information-rich-themes-v4.pdf)
* **Extension Methods** -- add methods to classes you don't own, comparable to the same feature in [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods) and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html)
* **Structural Typing** -- type-safe duck typing, much like interfaces in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html) and [Go](https://tour.golang.org/methods/10)

Leveraging these key features Manifold delivers a set of high-level components you can plug into your project, these
include:
* **JSON** and **JSON Schema** integration
* Type-safe **Templating** 
* **Structural interfaces** and **Expando** objects
* **Extension libraries** for collections, I/O, and text
* **JavaScript** interop (experimental)
* **SQL** and **DDL** interop (coming soon)
* Lots more

All with comprehensive support in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download).
