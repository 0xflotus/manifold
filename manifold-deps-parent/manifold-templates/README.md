# Manifold Templates

Manifold Templates is a lightweight & type safe templating technology for the JVM.
It is modeled loosely on Java Server Pages (JSP), but is divorced from the Servlet API and thus can be
used in any application environment.

Manifold Templates supports type safe arguments to templates, type safe inclusion of other templates,
shared layouts for templates and custom base classes for application-specific logic, among other features.

Manifold Templates have the suffix `mtf` (Manifold Template File), often optionally preceded by the language that the
template is targeting (e.g. `index.html.mtf`).
